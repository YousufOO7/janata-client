<p>Description: I developed a website using MySQL and Node.js for the backend and React.js for the frontend. Since I specialize in the MERN stack, working with MySQL was a new challenge for me. I spent 1-2 days exploring MySQL to understand its implementation. While I successfully completed the project by March 23rd, I faced difficulties deploying the backend for free, which prevented me from making the project live. I hope you take this into consideration.</p>
